# Unity Character Selection System

It's a scroll system for objects in 3D world. My aim is to use it for the game that now I'm working on.
but can be used in all sorts of cases. Swap detection is also available for mobile support as this is system
will be used on game targeted for mobile platform. 

I have used [LitMotion](https://github.com/AnnulusGames/LitMotion/tree/main) package for the movement of 
objects in my game.

The aim is to give each characater a unique environment and show case it, from where they came from or where the characters will 
be playing at while in the selection menu.
